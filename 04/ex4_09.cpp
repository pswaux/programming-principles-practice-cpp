/**
 * Exercise 4_9
 *
 * Try to calculate the number of rice grains that the inventor asked for in 
 * exercise 8 above. Youâ€™ll find that the number is so large that it wonâ€™t fit 
 * in an int or a double. Observe what happens when the number gets too large to 
 * represent exactly as an int and as a double. What is the largest number of 
 * squares for which you can calculate the exact number of grains (using an int)? 
 * What is the largest number of squares for which you can calculate the approximate 
 * number of grains (using a double)?
