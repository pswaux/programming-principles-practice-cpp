/**
 * Exercise 3_8
 *
 * Write a program to test an integer value to determine if it is odd or even. 
 * As always, make sure your output is clear and complete. In other words, 
 * donâ€™t just output yes or no. Your output should stand alone, 
 * like The value 4 is an even number. Hint: See the remainder (modulo) operator 
 * in section 3.4.
