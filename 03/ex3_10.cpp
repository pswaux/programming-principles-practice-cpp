/**
 * Exercise 3_10
 *
 * Write a program that takes an operation followed by two operands and 
 * outputs the result. For example:
 *    
 *    + 100 3.14
 *    * 4 5
 *
 * Read the operation into a string called operation and use an if-statement 
 * to figure out which operation the user wants, for example, if (operation=="+"). 
 * Read the operands into variables of type double. Implement this for operations 
 * called +, â€“, *, /, plus, minus, mul, and div with their obvious meanings.
